# Ecommerce-Funnel-Analysis-GA4-BigQuery-Tableau
Objective: The goal of this project was to analyze an ecommerce conversion funnel using data from GA4 exported to BigQuery. I designed and built a full pipeline â€” from SQL queries and data cleaning to interactive visualizations in Tableau

## Tasks completed:
ðŸ”¹ Extracted key session parameters (device, country, traffic source, etc.) and funnel events (view item, add to cart, checkout, purchase) using SQL

ðŸ”¹ Built a proper session-event join logic in BigQuery to preserve all sessions and avoid data loss

ðŸ”¹ Cleaned and exported the data to CSV (handled format issues and datatype bugs)

ðŸ”¹ Designed a Tableau dashboard with filters by country, language, device, campaign, and landing page

ðŸ”¹ Created key KPI tiles, a visualized funnel, maps, and segmentation charts

## Key features:
ðŸ“Š Interactive dashboard:

Conversion funnel

KPI tiles (sessions, orders, purchases, conversion rate)

Traffic source and campaign analysis

Country/language/device segmentation

Purchase heatmap by country

Flexible filters for advanced analysis

## Target user:
Digital marketer who needs fast insights into traffic performance and conversion behavior.
